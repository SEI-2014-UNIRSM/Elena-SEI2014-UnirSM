/ / I wanted to create a chess board consists of 5 rectangles that would change color 
/ / Depending on the movement of the mouse

int stepX;
int stepY;


void setup() {
  size(720, 720);
  noCursor();
}


void draw() {

  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100); //color mode HSB
 rectMode(CENTER); 
  noStroke();
  background(mouseY/2, mouseX/2, random (HSB)); // the background depends on the movement of the mouse on the axis x and y and the random value hsb
  

  stepX = mouseX+2;
  stepY = mouseY+2;
  for (int gridY=0; gridY<height; gridY+=stepY){
    for (int gridX=0; gridX<width; gridX+=stepX){
      
      fill(gridX, height-gridY, 100);
   
  rect(360, 360, mouseX+1, mouseX+1);
  rect(200,200,mouseX+1, mouseX+1);
  rect(520,200,mouseX+1, mouseX+1);
  rect(200,520,mouseX+1, mouseX+1);
  rect(520,520,mouseX+1, mouseX+1);
  
  / / draw 5 rectangles based on the x and y position of the mouse movement on the axis x and y +1
  }
}
