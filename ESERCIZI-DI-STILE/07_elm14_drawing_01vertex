//I wanted to create forms with 2 fixed vertex and two movable vertex (according to the movement of the mouse)

void setup(){
size (600,600);
}


void draw(){
background(250);
noStroke();
fill( random (150),random (250),random (100),100);
beginShape();
vertex(mouseX, mouseY);// One of the top 2 moves with the mouse
vertex(150, 300);
vertex(mouseY, mouseX);// One of the top 2 moves with the mouse
vertex(500, 300);
endShape(CLOSE);

}
